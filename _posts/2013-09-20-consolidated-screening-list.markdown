## ITA Consolidated Screening List

ITA in conjunction with the Departments of Commerce, State and the Treasury publishes the Consolidated Screening List to help exporters screen potential parties with whom they may do business. Developers can use this API to keep exporters aware of foreign companies that they may not do business with.

###Additional Information You Should Provide to Your Users

In the event that a company, entity, or person on the list appears to match a party potentially involved in an export transaction, businesses must conduct additional due diligence before proceeding. When doing business with someone on this list there may be:

- A strict export prohibition
- A requirement for seeking a license application
- An evaluation of the end-use or user to ensure it does not result in an activity prohibited by any U.S. export regulations
- Other restrictions.

Prior to taking any further actions, users are to consult the requirements of the specific list on which the company, entity or person is identified by reviewing the webpage of the agency responsible for such list. The links below will connect you to the specific webpage where additional information about how to use each specific list is contained. These links are also embedded into the file for each listed entity to direct you to the proper website for information about how to resolve the issue. Note that the column on the attached file, which is titled “Source List”, indicates which specific consolidated screening list is the source for each entry on the spreadsheet. Blank data fields in the file are not applicable to the consolidated screening list in the “Source List” column.
