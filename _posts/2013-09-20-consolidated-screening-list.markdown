## ITA's Consolidated Screening List

Below is a link to a downloadable file that consolidates export screening lists of the Departments of Commerce, State and the Treasury into one spreadsheet as an aide to industry in conducting electronic screens of potential parties to regulated transactions. In the event that a company, entity or person on the list appears to match a party potentially involved in your export transaction, additional due diligence should be conducted before proceeding. There may be a strict export prohibition, requirement for seeking a license application, evaluation of the end-use or user to ensure it does not result in an activity prohibited by any U.S. export regulations, or other restriction.

Prior to taking any further actions, users are to consult the requirements of the specific list on which the company, entity or person is identified by reviewing the webpage of the agency responsible for such list. The links below will connect you to the specific webpage where additional information about how to use each specific list is contained. These links are also embedded into the file for each listed entity to direct you to the proper website for information about how to resolve the issue. Note that the column on the attached file, which is titled “Source List”, indicates which specific consolidated screening list is the source for each entry on the spreadsheet. Blank data fields in the file are not applicable to the consolidated screening list in the “Source List” column.
