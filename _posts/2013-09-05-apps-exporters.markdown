#Apps for Exporters

ITA encourages developers to use the APIs to build applications that benefit businesses who export their products and services overseas.  Developers can also enhance their existing applications by mashing ITA’s data with other trade-related data.  The data sets particularly useful as they originate from authoritative, federal government sources.

We are particularly interested in applications that help businesses:
* Learn about exporting and have only just gotten started
* Get ready to export and find where to start
* Expand their existing exporting business.

For example, the API includes ITA’s Trade Events that developers can integrate with an existing application that provides general events for businesses.  Or, developers who have applications that provide business news and insight can use ITA’s Market Research Abstracts to enhance their offering.

We are building an app gallery to show off different uses of the data.  We welcome developers to  submit their apps for consideration.
