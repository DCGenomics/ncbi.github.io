# ITA Web Services - API Documentation

## Overview
The International Trade Administration (ITA) within the Department of Commerce (DOC) offers access to their public data via an Application Program Interface (API).  ITA provides information that is specifically targeted to businesses that are interested in exporting their products and services overseas.  For example, the API includes Trade Events that businesses may be interested in attending and Market Research Reports that provide insight into the current exporting environment.

Developers who work with trade and exporting information will find this information particularly useful as it originates from authoritative, federal government sources.  The API allows developers to create new and innovative applications for the web or mobile devices by enabling them to mash it with other trade-related data.

Use of the ITA APIs and other data is free of charge, but developers must [register with ITA](/_posts/registration-page) to receive a development key and agree to the guidelines outlined in the [Developer License Agreement]({{ site.baseurl }}/developer-license-agreement.html) and [Privacy Policy]({{ site.baseurl }}/privacy-policy.html). 

## Summary of Available APIs
